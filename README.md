### Prerequisites
python 3.7
Pytorch 1.3

### Quick start
Training: run main function with toy dataset
```
python main.py
```
Test: run main function with trained model
```
python main.py --train false
```

### Toy dataset
We create a toy dataset with 2D cardiac SAX data from [ACDC Challenge](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Challenge/acdc/). In the data folder, we have kdata(undersample k-space data), mask(undersampling mask, undersampling rate=0.875), fully(fully sampled k-space data) and image(fully sampled magnitude image). If you want to run your own dataset, just place the your data into the data folder.
